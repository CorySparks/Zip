# Zip - Win Free Money
A cross platform Unity 3D mobile app.

Users create an account using a username, password, and phone number to validate one account per user.

The user is greeted with 3 free turns after they create an account for the first time.
After those turns are up they must watch an ad in its entirety to collect another turn. 

These turns are spent by allowing the game to randomly pick a box on screen.
What is under the box is the reward the user obtains.

The rewards range from “Zip” (0) to $2.

Once a user hits the $25 limit, they will have the choice to collect the money through PayPal.
Money is generated to fund these actions through ads.

To increase profits users will be able to buy turns with the money they have earned. 
The likelyhood of the user getting any fold back is very unlikely.

*Disclaimer*
This is not a gambling app due to the fact that there are no real money purchases in the application. 
With that being said anyone can download this app and participate.
